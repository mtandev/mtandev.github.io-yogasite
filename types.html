						Hatha

				<div class="col-md-6">
          <p>"Hatha" is a Sanskrit term that refers to any type of yoga that teaches physical postures. Almost all styles of yoga taught in the West are hatha yoga.
            Classes labeled as Hatha typically move at a slower pace. You'll focus more on the basics and hold each pose for a few breaths. You might not build up a
          sweat, but you'll feel lighter, looser, and more relaxed after.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
          <b>You'll like it if:</b> You're a beginner. You'll get a soft introduction to a variety of basic yoga poses.

						Vinyasa

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
          <p>This type of yoga is movement-intensive. It focuses on linking breath and movement in a fluid, dance-like transition from pose to pose. Vinyasa classes are usually taught with
          music whose beats are in sync with the sequence of poses. No two Vinyasa classes are ever the same. Sequences vary depending on the teacher with no two flows having the same combination of postures.
        You will work up a sweat.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
          <b>You'll like it if:</b> You like to test your physical limits and enjoy variation. Runners and athletes tend to like Vinyasa yoga for its continuous movement.

						Ashtanga

				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            Similar to Vinyasa, Ashtanga links movement to breath. The difference is that in Ashtanga you will be doing the same poses in the exact same order every time.
            You will flow through a series of specifically sequenced poses, moving and breathing through each pose to build internal heat. This is a challenging practice and
            not designed for beginners.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            Like Ashtanga, Bikram always follows the same sequence. There is a series of 26 poses, each performed twice, that students will move through in a heated room. Bikram classes are <i>hot</i>.
            The temperature is typically set to 105 degrees and 40 percent humidity. Be prepared to sweat. You'll need water close by. Bikram classes are also very popular and are easy to find.

            Kundalini yoga focuses on increasing self awareness and releasing the untapped energy trapped within you. It's a mix of spiritual and physical practice. This type of yoga will work your core
            and breathing with invigorating postures and breath exercises. You'll do kriyas (repetitive movements coupled with intense breath work) while also chanting and
            meditating.

            If you want a meditative practice, but aren't really into chanting, you may like Yin Yoga. The classes are slow paced. Each pose is held anywhere from 45 seconds to two minutes.
            Yin Yoga is designed to target your deeper connective tissues and fascia, to restore length and elasticity. You release in to the poses instead of engaging or flexing the muscles.
            Yin will help activate change in your body from the deepest level.

            Restorative yoga is exactly what it sounds like â€” it restores the body. You'll use bolsters, blankets, and blocks to prop yourself
            into passive poses so your body can experience the benefits of a pose without having to exert any effort. Classes are slow moving and mellow.
            You'll feel a deeper sense of relaxation and rejuvenation after.
